## API base URL (Expo SDK 54)

This app now prefers `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` for the backend base URL. Set it before starting Metro:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ASUS TUF\Desktop\New folder\mobile"
$env:EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = "http://10.159.201.40:4000/api"
npm start
```

- Replace `10.159.201.40` with your PC's IPv4 (see `ipconfig`).
- Android emulator is auto-handled (`10.0.2.2`).
- If the backend falls back to a different port (e.g., 4001), update the URL accordingly.

From your phoneâ€™s browser, you should be able to open: `http://10.159.201.40:4000/api/health`.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
